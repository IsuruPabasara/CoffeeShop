Developed an automated seating system that uses body heat to capture available and taken seats to direct customers arriving at a coffee shop. 
Used the nRF52 development kit as peripherals(seats) and a laptop(welcome register) as the central device for Bluetooth Low Energy communication 
so the whole setup can be wireless and low power consuming. 
Used Kivy to write a simple GUI for visual feedback.
